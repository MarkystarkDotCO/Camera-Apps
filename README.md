# Camera-Apps
This it my first time to build Android Application.
# What I learn ?
I learn a lot of things in this project.
First, I try to create a button and made its method (I was did the same in java GUI so it's not interesting).
Second, I configs XML to connect the device ( a camera).
Finally, It' work !, I can make a picture and I can save it on device 
# In the future I will send a picture to my machine learning on Azure
# In Android Studio
